Reflexbox is a React grid system composed of the
<Flex /> and <Box /> components.
The Flex component creates a flexbox context and
controls direction, alignment, justification, and gutter compensation.
The Box component controls padding, flex-basis, and width.
With breakpoint-based responsive styles,
these two components can handle virtually all layout styling needs.
`

const p2 = `
These components are tested with Reactâ€™s shallow rendering
as well as browser tests in Karma at four different breakpoints.
